*Pssst, hey! Over here! Yeah, me, the top note ontop of the README.*
*This is the template only! If you are looking to contribute to Spirus, go to that repo!*

# Spirus Template

This is a project template for [Spirus](https://github.com/SpirusDev/Spirus) games.

*Note that you will need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed, as this project uses TypeScript!*

## Get started

Make template with [degit](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/degit):

```bash
eclipse@root $: npx degit spirusdev/template spirus-project
eclipse@root $: cd spirus-project
```

After that, install dependencies

```bash
eclipse@root $: npm install
```

Now develop real-time with

```bash
eclipse@root $: npm run start
```

Now go to the link it says in your terminal.

## Compilation

If you wish to compile, run this command

```bash
eclipse@root $: npm run build
```

After that, go into `/dist` and *voila*! Your newly prepared `index.html`, `index.css` and `index.js` are ready
